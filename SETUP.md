### Config object passed to constructor:

```
{
    "client_id": "",
    "team_id": "",
    "key_id": "",
}
```

The `client_id` is actually called the "Service ID" that you will create in the 'Identifiers' section

The `team_id` is the 10 character code on the top left of the developer page next to your name.

The `key_id` is the identifier for the private key you generated
